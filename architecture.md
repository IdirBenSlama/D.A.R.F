# DARF Framework Architecture

## Overview

The Decentralized Autonomous Reaction Framework (DARF) is a comprehensive system designed with modularity and flexibility in mind. This document outlines the high-level architecture, core components, and how they interact.

## Architectural Principles

DARF is built on several key architectural principles:

1. **Modularity**: Components are designed to be loosely coupled, allowing them to be replaced or enhanced independently.
2. **Configurability**: The framework can be configured for different operational modes and use cases.
3. **Scalability**: Components can be scaled horizontally or vertically depending on workload.
4. **Fault Tolerance**: The system is designed to gracefully handle failures in individual components.
5. **Security**: Security is integrated throughout the architecture, not as an afterthought.

## Core Components

### Frontend (darf_frontend/)

The frontend is a TypeScript/React application that provides the user interface for interacting with the DARF framework. It communicates with the backend through a REST API.

Key features:
- Modern React components with TypeScript
- State management
- UI for visualizing knowledge graphs and data
- Interactive controls for system management

### Backend (darf_webapp/)

The backend is a Python-based application that provides the API for the frontend and manages the core system components.

Key features:
- Flask-based REST API
- Authentication and authorization
- Request validation and processing
- Integration with core components

### Knowledge Graph

The knowledge graph is the central data structure for storing and relating information in the DARF framework.

Key features:
- Graph data structure for representing complex relationships
- Query interface for retrieving related information
- Versioning and history tracking
- Integration with LLM systems

### Event Bus

The event bus provides a publish-subscribe messaging system for communication between components.

Key features:
- Asynchronous message passing
- Event routing and filtering
- Guaranteed delivery
- Event persistence and replay

### LLM Interface

The LLM (Large Language Model) interface provides integration with various AI language models.

## Operation Modes

The DARF framework can operate in several modes, each with a different set of active components:

### Standard Mode

All components are active, providing full functionality.

### Debug Mode

Additional instrumentation is enabled, with verbose logging and debugging tools.

### Dashboard Mode

Only the dashboard and monitoring components are active, providing system visibility without full functionality.

### Minimal Mode

Only the core components are active, providing basic functionality with minimal resource usage.

### Secure Mode

Enhanced security features are enabled, with additional authentication and encryption.

## Communication Patterns

Components in the DARF framework communicate using several patterns:

1. **REST API**: For synchronous request-response communication, primarily between the frontend and backend.
2. **Event-based**: For asynchronous communication between components, using the event bus.
3. **Direct Function Calls**: For in-process communication within a component.
4. **File-based**: For bulk data transfer and persistence.

## Configuration System

The configuration system in DARF provides a flexible way to configure the framework for different scenarios:

1. **File-based Configuration**: JSON configuration files for static configuration.
2. **Environment Variables**: For deployment-specific configuration.
3. **Command-line Arguments**: For runtime configuration.
4. **Default Values**: For fallback when configuration is not specified.

## Development and Extension

The DARF framework is designed to be extended with new components and functionality:

1. **Plugin System**: Add new functionality without modifying the core codebase.
2. **API Hooks**: Integration points for external systems.
3. **Custom Components**: Replace or extend existing components with custom implementations.
4. **Configuration Extensions**: Add new configuration options for custom components.

## Security Considerations

Security is a core concern in the DARF framework:

1. **Authentication**: User identity verification.
2. **Authorization**: Permission management.
3. **Encryption**: Data protection.
4. **Audit Logging**: Activity tracking for security monitoring.
5. **Input Validation**: Protection against injection attacks.
6. **Secure Defaults**: Secure configuration by default.

## Deployment Architecture

The DARF framework can be deployed in various configurations:

1. **Single Process**: All components in a single process for simplicity.
2. **Microservices**: Components deployed as separate services for scalability.
3. **Serverless**: Some components deployed as serverless functions for cost efficiency.
4. **Hybrid**: Mix of deployment models based on component requirements.

## Conclusion

The DARF architecture provides a flexible, modular framework for building decentralized autonomous systems. By understanding the core components and their interactions, developers can effectively extend and customize the framework for their specific needs.
